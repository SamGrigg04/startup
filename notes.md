# CS 260 Notes

REACT Part 2 TODO:
[ ] Fix space at top & bottom
[ ] Pages "locked" until you login (or at least put something in the text box.) (LocalStorage) (useState?)
[ ] Stopwatch starts upon selecting the guess textbox and stops upon the correct answer
[ ] Spoof the API call (have like, 4 or 5 number facts that will show up when you input that number) (useEffect)
[ ] Generate the random number to be guessed upon selecting the text box (so you can't fish through the page and find the variable)
[ ] Procedurally generate hints (higher/lower)
[ ] Update Scores with user data (add personal high score section w/ CSS animation?)
[ ] Notification of other player activity (setInterval)
