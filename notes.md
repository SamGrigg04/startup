# CS 260 Notes

REACT Part 2 TODO:
- [x] Fix space at top & bottom
- [x] Pages "locked" until you login (or at least put something in the text box.) (LocalStorage) (useState?)
- [x] Stopwatch starts upon selecting the guess textbox and stops upon the correct answer
- [x] Spoof the API call (have like, 4 or 5 number facts that will show up when you input that number) (useEffect)
- [x] Generate the random number to be guessed upon selecting the text box (so you can't fish through the page and find the variable)
- [x] Procedurally generate hints (higher/lower)
- [x] Set the styling for hint to change based on what it is
- [x] Update the scoreboard upon a game ending
- [x] Make another scoreboard so one shows local and one global, animate a transition
